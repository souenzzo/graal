# Native Image Workshops and Interactive Labs

Consider running interactive workshops in Oracle Cloud to get some practical experience. 
The interactive cloud platform provides a temporary account for a user for the time he runs a lab with required cloud resources (virtual machine, Oracle Linux, storage etc.).
That means you can try Native Image without downloading any additional software to your computer.

Go to [Luna Labs](https://luna.oracle.com/) and search for "Native Image". 
The following labs are available:

- [GraalVM Native Image Quick Start](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/47dafec8-4095-4fba-8313-dad43a64dee4): This labs is developers new to Native Image and looking to start building cloud native Java applications.
- [GraalVM, Reflection and Native Image](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/5fde71fb-8044-4c82-aa1c-3f2e5771caed):
This lab shows how to pre-configure the `native-image` builder when reflection is used, and make your Java application compatible with ahead-of-time compilation using Native Image.
- [GraalVM Native Image Debugging](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/cbe9d331-5dbc-4300-a5ca-20b88346cbcf): This lab shows how to debug a native executable in a running state from VS Code.
- [GraalVM Native Image, Spring and Containerisation](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/fdfd090d-e52c-4481-a8de-dccecdca7d68): This lab shows how to package a Spring Boot application into a native executable; containerise it; shrink the footprint even more  by creating small a Distroless container Image.
- [GraalVM Native Image, Micronaut and OCI MySQL](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/a78388fd-c15f-48b4-96aa-5e4716ae236c): In this lab, you will learn how to build a portable cloud-native Java application with Micronaut, GraalVM Native Image and MySQL Database service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
