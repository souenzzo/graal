# Native Image Workshops and Interactive Labs

Consider running interactive workshops in Oracle Cloud to get some practical experience. 
The interactive cloud platform provides a temporary account for a user for the time he runs a lab with required cloud resources (virtual machine, Oracle Linux, storage etc.).
That means you can try Native Image without downloading any additional software to your computer.

Go to [Luna Labs](https://luna.oracle.com/) and search for "Native Image". 
The following labs are available:

- [GraalVM Native Image, Spring and Containerisation](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/fdfd090d-e52c-4481-a8de-dccecdca7d68). This lab shows how to package a Spring Boot application into a native executable; create small a Distroless container to package that native executable in it; shrink your Docker Images.
- [GraalVM Native Image Debugging](https://luna.oracle.com/lab/cbe9d331-5dbc-4300-a5ca-20b88346cbcf). This lab shows how to debug a native executable in a running state from VS Code.
