# Debugging Native Executables

You can debug a native executable in a running state directly from within an IDE. 
This functionality is available from Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the GraalVM for Java extension installed.
You can experience a Java-like debugging of a native executable, set breakpoints, inspect the state of your application, even attach the debugger to a native executable process in VS Code and step over your Java application source code.
