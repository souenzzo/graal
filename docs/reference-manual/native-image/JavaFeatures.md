# Java Features in Native Image

When you build a native image, it only includes the reachable elements starting from your application entry point, its dependent libraries, and the JDK classes discovered through a static analysis. 
However, the reachability of some elements may not be discoverable due to Javaâ€™s dynamic features including reflection, resource access, etc. 
If an element is not reachable, it will not be included in the generated binary and this can lead to run time failures.

Thus, some Java features may require special "treatment" like a command line option or provisioning metadata to be susceptible for ahead-of-time compilation with Native Image. 

The reference information here explains how Native Image handles some Java features under the hood.
